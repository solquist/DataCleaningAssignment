# Aggregation of Samsung Galaxy smartphone accelerometer data

## Introduction

This data set is a derivation of data from a study of 30 volunteers wearing a smartphone while performing various activities such as walking up stairs, laying down, and sitting.<sup>1</sup>. More information about the study can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#).

This codebook explains the derived data found in "AverageValueBySubjectAndActivity.txt". At a high level, this data set is an aggregation of some of the measurements (explained in more detail in the Processed Data section) found in the raw data for each unique volunteer and activity combination.
