# Cleaning the Samsung Galaxy smartphone accelerometer data

The source data was collected from Samsung Galazy smartphones and obtained through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#). It contains information from a group of 30 volunteers performing various activities such as walking up stairs, laying down, sitting, and more.

The data cleaning was done through the script [run_analysi.R](https://github.com/solquist/DataCleaningAssignment). At a high level, the script performs the following required tasks from the data cleaning assignment:

1. [Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.](#merge)
2. [Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.](#extract) 
3. [Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.](#activity)
4. [Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.](#variable)
5. [From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.](#tidy)

In addition to the data processing steps, the analysis script also takes care of [reading in the data](#read) and [saving out the final tidy data set](#save) as XXX. The variables for the resulting data set are defined in [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/solquist/DataCleaningAssignment)
