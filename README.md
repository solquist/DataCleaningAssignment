# Cleaning the Samsung Galaxy smartphone accelerometer data

The source data was collected from Samsung Galazy smartphones and obtained through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#). It contains information from a group of 30 volunteers performing various activities such as walking up stairs, laying down, sitting, and more.

The data cleaning was done through the script [run_analysi.R](https://github.com/solquist/DataCleaningAssignment). At a high level, the script performs the following required tasks from the data cleaning assignment:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In addition to the data processing steps, the analysis script also takes care of reading in the data and saving out the final tidy data set as XXX. The variables for the resulting data set are defined in [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/solquist/DataCleaningAssignment)
